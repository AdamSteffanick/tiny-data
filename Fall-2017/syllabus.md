In this working group, we discuss how to collect, manipulate, analyze, and publish small- and medium-scaled datasets for use in humanistic research. By examining the data behind diverse digital humanities projects, discussing readings about quantitative and qualitative data, and experimenting with data visualization tools such as Neo4j and Tableau Public, we aim to build a collaborative and multi-disciplinary cohort of data-literate humanists across campus.
