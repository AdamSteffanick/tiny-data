## Week II: Scalability

#### Questions raised during reading discussion
- What humanities data are valuable? If you selectively extract data from a digitally-published text or resource, what value is there in making it available?
- How can subjective data (e.g. observations) be reusable?
- What is the distinction between raw and processed data? Are both types of data useful?

#### Review of Cass Gilbert's Woolworth Building Scalar Project
- What are the benefits and challenges of utilizing Scalar for a digital project?
  - \+ It is built on a graph data model, enabling non-linear engagement with its contents
  - \+ It allows for relatively easy creation of metadata using Dublin Core standards, facilitating good data management practices
  - \+/- It is a media-intensive platform, well-equipped to display images, videos, and other non-textual data but less useful for more textually-driven digital projects
  - \- It is more for presentation of completed research than exploration of data and sources
    - Systematically extracting data and metadata is not feasible
    - Paths through the content must still be pre-defined
- How is the project an example of Tiny Data in practice?
  - Investment in metadata and infrastructure - a small collection (c. 30 drawings), but well-annotated
  - Expandable by adding more items and/or systematically enriching annotations/metadata

#### Next Week: Bring Your Research (Data) Workshop
- What are your research questions?
- What are your data?
- How did you collect your data and how do they relate to your research questions?

Participants: upload your data and a brief, 1-paragraph abstract about your data (whatever form they're in) to the Tiny Data Working Group box account (link to be sent via e-mail); download and install [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/)  
Organizers: in addition, review participant data and abstracts, determine what other tool(s) to introduce to work with datasets provided
