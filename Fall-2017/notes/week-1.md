## Week I: What is Tiny Data?
#### The point of the working group is:
- To critically examine the space between humanities data and research questions
- To explore paths for intellectually-rigorous and methodologically-sound visualization-based DH projects
- To enable participants to craft meaningful, consistent, coherent, and human-scaled datasets for their own research
- To foster familiarity with the tools, methods, advantages, and challenges of data-based humanistic inquiry
- To generate a ‘Tiny Data Checklist’ for getting started with small-scale, data-driven, humanistic research

#### The structure of the working group is:
- 1-hour weekly meetings, 11 meetings in Fall 2017
- Three workshop days (bring your datasets!)
- One or two critical readings and one or two project analyses per non-workshop meeting

#### Questions to ask about DH projects
- What ARE the data?
  - Data vs. metadata?
  - Primary vs. secondary vs. tertiary data?
  - How do you define and design humanities data?
  - How much intellectual effort is expended in the preliminary data curation work?
- What is the total cost of this project?
  - How many people does it take to make a project run?
  - How long does it take?
  - How much does it cost financially (directly/indirectly)?
- What is the scope of the project?
  - Is it based on data? methods? research questions?
  - Who is the audience?
- How modular are these projects?
  - How can you scale up/scale down these projects?
  - What is iterative design and does the term apply to these projects?
- What is a DH project?
  - Is an archive a DH project?
  - How big does a project have to be to ‘count’ as an intellectual contribution?

Goals for next meeting on Tuesday, September 19:
Participants: do the reading(s), check out the project(s), and come ready to discuss the data, sites, and ideas!
Organizers: in addition, review participants’ goals for the semester, update website notes
