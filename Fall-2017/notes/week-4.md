## Bring Your Research (Data) Workshop (cont'd)

#### Resources
- For data-wrangling needs, check out [Open Refine](http://openrefine.org/)
  - The three tutorials embedded on the first page are a good place to start learning what Open Refine can do for your data.
- For a more step-by-step, written guide to using Open Refine, check out the [Data Carpentry lesson](http://www.datacarpentry.org/OpenRefine-ecology-lesson/) on it.

#### Next Week: Digital Project Methodology and Data vs. Metadata
Participants: Complete the readings and look at the projects (available on the [syllabus](https://github.com/HeardLibrary/tiny-data/blob/gh-pages/Fall-2017/syllabus.md)), thinking about the questions we outlined in [week 1](https://github.com/HeardLibrary/tiny-data/blob/gh-pages/Fall-2017/notes/week-1.md).  
Organizers: Start compiling session notes into preliminary draft of "Getting Started with Humanities Data Wrangling" guide.
