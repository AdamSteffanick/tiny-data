## Week III: Bring Your Research (Data) Workshop I

#### Questions raised during project discussion
- How to standardize data and vocabulary?
- Explain your spreadsheet headers to capture definitions and vocabulary for scale-able metadata that can be replicated
- How to insure controlled vocabulary to make others' participation and use of your data possible in future
- Metadata makes your ideas / connections visible

#### Project Data & Workshops  

Aphorisms (1893) 500 written and published by Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach
- What’s the relationship between meaning & structure? 
-	Several have multiple authors; interest in multiple authors in communal process 
-	How does word count relate to topic?
-	What is aggregative rather than analytical? 
- Process: Rhyme scheme & meter; used Hathi simple text used but only line breaks; compare manual v. computational counts
  - Visible/not links to topic/subject
  - Add more columns for ambiguity; Clean up linguistic v. semantic example.
  - Columns = Keywords = Legend
  - Syllables counted manually (write out your methodology; data chosen because of XXX to answer your question YYY) 

DSM & Sexuality (people, category, diagnosis)
- Large numbers of revisioners not included in final DSM--how to capture their involvement?
- Create a key for stable elements of diagnosis; this sets up for Neo4j or other data model.  Consider working backwards i.e. make a people spreadsheet w/ identifier. 
- Discussion of relationships solved in spreadsheets. Curating data means explaining what you did; with good documentation, data can be used again by others.
- Data model is part of linking but doesn’t stand alone.  Describe your rows & columns in separate spreadsheet.
- Neo4j has limits when data hand-loaded in. Questioning the graph is questioning the patterns.  A graph's value goes beyond visualization, beyond rows and columns.  

Ghettos
- Regional killing machines v. Auschwitz as European killing center
- Issues with non-standard vocabularies across two different ghettos lists

Next Week--Bring Your Research (Data) Workshop II (cont'd)
  - Open Refine demonstration
  - Discussions continue about how to clean up data 

Participants will: bring their data
Organizers will: walk through a completed project, demonstrate Open Refine with a data set from the group
